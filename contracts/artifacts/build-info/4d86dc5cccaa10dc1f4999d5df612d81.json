This means that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}. TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.",

To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.

For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`). Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless it's overridden.

To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification."
